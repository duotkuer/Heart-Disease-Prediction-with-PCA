# Heart Disease Prediction with PCA

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The dataset is preprocessed, scaled, and analyzed to build a predictive model.

## Features

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information.
- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Bar graphs and pie charts are plotted to analyze the distribution of males and females with heart disease.

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
